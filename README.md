## About me
Hi ðŸ‘‹. My name is Sami, and I am a `Software Developer` living in the U.S ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸

## Tech skills
I am Software Engineer, that's it. I do not like the idea of labeling myself a an expert of certain framework or programming language. I know how to solve problems, no matter what the language,
the framework or the platform may be, what I know is that with enough time I will figure it out.
