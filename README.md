## 💫 About me
Hi 👋. My name is Sami, and I am a `Software Developer` living in the U.S 🇺🇸


## 👨‍💻 Tech skills
I am a Software Engineer, that's it. I do not like the idea of labeling myself a an expert of certain framework or programming language. I know how to solve problems, no matter what the language, the framework or the platform might be, what I know is that with enough time and hard work I will figure it out. 


## 🌱 What I am currently doing
After doing a fair amount of web development I decided I would pick up C, and to be quite honest I really enjoy it ! So most of my time, I spend write C programs and learning different things.
