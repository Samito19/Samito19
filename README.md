## 💫 About me
Hi 👋. My name is Sami, and I am a `Software Engineer` living in the U.S 🇺🇸


## 👨‍💻 Tech skills
I am a Software Engineer, that's it. I do not like the idea of labeling myself a an expert of certain framework or programming language. I know how to solve problems, no matter what the language, the framework or the platform might be, what I know is that, with enough time and hard work I will figure it out.
